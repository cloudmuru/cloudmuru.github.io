        <h3>It's ____ day today!</h3>
        <p>18th of September in the year of 2002 is the day that you were born.<br>
        You have stayed and made it to 2025 which is another year with me!<br>
        It's also your 23rd birthday and I wish the greatest wishes for you.</p>
        <p>This website is a gift that I built and programmed just for you and I hope that you would like it.<br>
        I am still not yet skilled enough to create and design my own original website so I could only alter what I found.<br>
        Although, I still did try my best to think, learn, create, and give you a unique and a rememberable birthday gift.<br>
        I do hope that somehow my gift would be able to stand out amongst the other gifts that you will be receiving from your beloved friends.</p>
