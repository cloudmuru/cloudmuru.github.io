        <h3>It's Kyle Bryane's day today!</h3>
        <p>18th of September in the year of 2002 is the day that you were born.<br>
        You have stayed and made it to 2025 which is another year with me!<br>
        It's also your 23rd birthday and I wish nothing but the greatest wishes for you.</p>
        <p>This website is a gift that I built and programmed just for you and I hope that you will like it.<br>
        I am still not yet skilled enough to create and design my own original website so I could only alter what I found.<br>
        Although, I still did try my best to think, learn, create, and give you a unique and a rememberable birthday gift.<br>
        I do hope that somehow my gift would be able to stand out amongst the other gifts that you will be receiving from your beloved friends.</p>

        <h3>To my dearest Kyle</h3>
        <p>This day might not be the happiest event in your life, but I want you to know that I will always be here<br>
        and willing to celebrate it with you. May it be silently or loudly, I will always do my best to make you happy<br>
        and I will always be proud to have you here with me through the years.</p>
        <p>Thank you for everything. I will always be grateful, always appreciate you, and be proud of you for every<br>
        single thing that you have given, brought, and caused to me. Some may be things that you are unconscious of, and<br>
        some are also things that I know you have always poured what you could have just for me. Regardless, of whatever<br>
        reason there may be, I have always noticed and you have always made me happy. I apologize for being too difficult<br>
        to deal with most of the time, but I hope you will still continue to stay by me.</p>
        <p>I hope that I could also make my cheri happy, not just for today, but always. I love you so much, cheri.</p>
